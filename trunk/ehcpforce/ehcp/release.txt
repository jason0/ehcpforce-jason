May, 2013:
by earnolmartin@gmail.com; some fixes; some fixes changed by ehcpdeveloper
Updated Installer:  http://pastebin.com/YMRy5X3v
Changes in classapp.php: http://pastebin.com/uWQCeuKA  (Starts at: /* Log Failed Authentication For Use with Fail2Ban */)
Changes in install_2.php:  http://pastebin.com/4ZhQw5u5 (Bug with nginx install in Ubuntu 12.10... could not find a patch or any way to fix it... only apache installs in 12.10... nginx and apache install fine on both 13.04 and 12.04)
Added fail2ban directory: (Used in Fail2Ban configuration if user wants to install Fail2Ban)
Added log directory: (unsuccessful logins are added to a file... which is used by Fail2Ban filter)
Allowed user input to decide if they want to allow BIND transfers during install (for slave DNS configurations, something I might need your help on integrating later... first I'll try myself.)

What's new in the installer:

Correct permissions after installing
VSFTPD fixed and working out of the box
Can install and configure fail2ban automatically for use with EHCP
Fixes log directory permissions
Correctly identifies distribution and version number

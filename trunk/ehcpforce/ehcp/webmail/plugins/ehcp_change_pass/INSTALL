Installing the EHCP Change Password Plugin
=========================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the Ehcp_change_ pass 
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar zxvf ehcp_change_pass.tar.gz
  
  change db pass in config.php
  

2) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins" 
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

3) Please verify that you have the "compatibility" plugin
   installed.
